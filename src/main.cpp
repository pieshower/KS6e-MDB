    Code for MDB. Not sure if it works lol.
    If I understand how the mux works then
    it should give a four pin analog output
    that is read and stored by the arduino

    Wrote something to output to SPI but I 
    cannot test any further at home other then
    just look at the output through a scope.

    Wrote my own Analog Read class because stupid
    Arduino would not let me call analogRead() 
    outside of the loop() function and I wanted
    my main() to look a certain way. 

    GET REKT ;)

    Found a possible SPI to CAN mega library.

    Need to implement and test. :)
